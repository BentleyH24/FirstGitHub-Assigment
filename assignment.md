## Red Rectangle Strategy One 

Two 75 cent meatshields, *Macho Leg Cat (30)*, *Awakened Bahamut Cat (30)*, and *Wall Cat* are required to survive the start of the stage for this setup. The rest of the units can be replaced with special cats, ubers, or money related cat combos to handle the enemies after the initial *Shibalien Elites* and *Star Peng*. The listed lineup is meant to be a minimal setup for accessibility and may take multiple tries with these exact levels and units (higher normal cat levels or better units will improve consistency). For higher normal cat levels (20+30 or higher), refer to Strategy 2.

The goal is to stall the *Shibalien Elites* with *Samba* and *Macho Cat* until you have enough cash to send out *Awakened Bahamut Cat*. At the start, spam *Macho* and *Samba Cats*. When the first *B.B. Bunny* spawns, send one *Macho Leg Cat*. This should kill the *B.B. Bunny* for more cash and slow down the enemy pushing. Keep spamming *Macho* and *Samba cats* until you get enough money to send out *Awakened Bahamut Cat*. If you have around 4000 cash and the *Shibalien Elites* are very close to the Cat Base, stop sending *Macho* and *Samba Cats* to save up for *Awakened Bahamut Cat* (otherwise you won't have enough cash/base health).

The Shibalien Elites will push to the base but Bahamut will knock them back and use the cat base as a shield. After sending Bahamut, spam Macho, Samba, and Wall Cats to stall and give Bahamut more time to knock them back. The Shibalien Elites should be cleared after two or three attacks and you should have enough room and cash to send out your other expensive/powerful units (if you replaced any of the normal cats with them) and win.

For the lineup mentioned at the start, you need to spam your meatshields and send one Dragon and one Macho Leg Cat to damage the Ginger Snaches. Once the first Star Peng dies, you can send out Ururun Cat and multiple Macho Leg and Dragon Cats. When the One Horn gets around 60% of the base (roughly when the second Pigge dies), send out Whale Cat.

After this point, Bahamut is at risk of dying; try to keep Bahamut alive as long as possible. Use the Cat Cannon when the One Horn is close to attacking to stall longer. If you have excess cash (above 5000), you can send out Mythical Titan and UFO Cat. Ideally, Bahamut will survive up to the two Imperator Saels and heavily damage the Star Peng supporting the Saels.

From there, you need to keep sending out Macho Leg Cats to deal with the aliens and save cash for another Awakened Bahamut Cat. Ururun Cat, Dragon Cats, and Macho Leg Cats should deal with the remaining starred aliens and survive long enough to send a second Awakened Bahamut Cat. After you send out the second Awakened Bahamut Cat, you basically won the stage.

For this guide, if Bahamut dies before damaging the Star Peng supporting the Imperator Saels, you should force restart and try again.
